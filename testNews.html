          The Indian Goods and Service Tax Council has decided to introduce a
          28% goods and service tax on internet gambling, horse racing, and
          casinos. The tax will be applied to both the stake's total value and
          the chips' cost. There won't be a distinction made between
          chance-based games and skill-based games.

          At the council's 50th meeting, the committee also decided to lower the
          tax on food and beverages served in movie theatres from 18% to 5% and
          to provide exemptions for several medicinal products.

            Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman commented: "The GST Act will be
            amended to include online gaming and horse racing. Very substantive
            discussions have taken place on the matter of online gaming. All the
            states presented their views today, including Sikkim and Goa, which
            see a lot of tourism for casinos."

            "Ignoring the long-time demand of the gaming industry, levying a 28%
            tax rate on the gaming industry will be a big setback for Indian
            players. We might immediately see notices being issued to the gaming
            players for differential tax and with this new series of
            litigation."

          <p class="newsText mb-5">
            Roland Landers, CEO, The All India Gaming Federation, added: "We
            believe this decision by the GST Council is unconstitutional,
            irrational and egregious. The decision ignores over 60 years of
            settled legal jurisprudence and lumps online skill gaming with
            gambling activities. This decision will wipe out the entire Indian
            gaming industry, lead to job losses, and the only people benefitting
            from this will be anti-national illegal offshore platforms."

        <h4 class="mb-5">What is the Victoria Wild West NFT collection?</h4>
        <p class="mb-5">
          The NFT collection is embedded directly into the game, with the NFT
          tokens randomly dropped while playing. The drop contains 15,000 NFTs
          of different rarity to help the main character achieve her mission.
          Each of the items has a high-utility rate and complements the
          storyline of the game. Upon receiving the token, the player can
          activate it right away in the pop-up window by means of TRUE iFrame
          solution, without disrupting the gameplay and leaving the platform for
          an external wallet. Players pick up NFTs during the gameplay, collect
          them in albums and craft higher-level NFTs to receive various
          benefits, up to a share of the Holders Treasury — a percentage of all
          bets placed on Victoria Wild West paid monthly. Crafting is one of the
          noticeable engaging tools implemented in the game. The collection
          features NFTs of various rarity, that can be used to craft tokens of
          higher value. There are 5 crafting levels, every level unlocking
          bigger rewards. As part of the collection 1,000 mystery boxes were
          released on the provider’s marketplace developed by TRUE within the
          turnkey white-label solution for the iGaming business. Mystery boxes
          can be unpacked and crafted, exchanged for benefits, or even resold on
          the external marketplace as is without opening.

        <h4 class="mb-5">Growth potential</h4>
        <p class="mb-5">
          The collection is already proving its success. The first results of
          the drop are promising indeed: the NFT activation conversion rate
          exceeds 50% among the players at the present moment, which goes far
          beyond provider’s expectations.

        <p class="mb-5">
          NFT gamification is performing at full pace and shows no signs of
          slowing down. According to data collected since product launch in
          March, the number of players increased by 72.9% with 44% increase in
          average sessions count per player.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="newsText mb-5">
            “By means of integrating NFT gamification mechanics into slot games,
            an iGaming provider can motivate players to come back and play more,
            expect the boost of engagement and retention, as well as increased
            volumes on the old game titles without the cost of new game
            production,” explains Dan Andrian, CEO of TRUE
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="mb-5">
          The teams also expect the new NFT mechanics to positively influence
          such metrics as bet size, bet count per session and bet count per
          player as the first results speak for themselves.
