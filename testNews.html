          Scatters in the form of golden orbs can land on any reel, triggering a
          free spins bonus round when three or more are hit during the base
          game. During the bonus, any wilds that land will remain on the reels
          until the round ends. Free spins can be instantly granted when players
          purchase them for 100x their bet in select markets, with up to five
          Scatters guaranteed to land on the triggering spin. Twilight Princess™
          is the latest title to join Pragmatic Play’s expansive portfolio. It
          follows recent releases Gravity Bonanza™ and Rainbow Reels™, with the
          supplier continuing to showcase its commitment to creating dynamic
          games to entertain players across the globe.
