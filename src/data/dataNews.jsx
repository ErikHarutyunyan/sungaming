          J3ster.gg, the innovative live-streaming betting company, is

        <p class="newsText mb-5">
          The new roulette-type bet sees players choose an even or odd number of

          streamer or gift the full amount.
        </p>
        <p class="newsText mb-5">
          These new bet types join the currently existing categories, meaning

        <p class="mb-5">
          The NFT collection is embedded directly into the game, with the NFT
          tokens randomly dropped while playing. The drop contains 15,000 NFTs
          of different rarity to help the main character achieve her mission.
          Each of the items has a high-utility rate and complements the
          storyline of the game. Upon receiving the token, the player can
          activate it right away in the pop-up window by means of TRUE iFrame
          solution, without disrupting the gameplay and leaving the platform for
          an external wallet. Players pick up NFTs during the gameplay, collect
          them in albums and craft higher-level NFTs to receive various
          benefits, up to a share of the Holders Treasury — a percentage of all
          bets placed on Victoria Wild West paid monthly. Crafting is one of the
          noticeable engaging tools implemented in the game. The collection
          features NFTs of various rarity, that can be used to craft tokens of
          higher value. There are 5 crafting levels, every level unlocking
          bigger rewards. As part of the collection 1,000 mystery boxes were
          released on the provider’s marketplace developed by TRUE within the
          turnkey white-label solution for the iGaming business. Mystery boxes
          can be unpacked and crafted, exchanged for benefits, or even resold on
          the external marketplace as is without opening.

        <h4 class="mb-5">Growth potential</h4>

          The collection is already proving its success. The first results of
          the drop are promising indeed: the NFT activation conversion rate
          exceeds 50% among the players at the present moment, which goes far
          beyond provider’s expectations.

        <p class="mb-5">
          NFT gamification is performing at full pace and shows no signs of
          slowing down. According to data collected since product launch in
          March, the number of players increased by 72.9% with 44% increase in
          average sessions count per player.
